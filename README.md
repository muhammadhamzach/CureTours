# CureTours

**Note:** This is part of the assessment at CureMD retraining program for Electrical Engineers

## Summary

The project is made to test out the knowledge of full-stack ASP.NET Technology along with SQL, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript.

### Project Notes:

* Only admin account is made by default and no users are added. Also no tour data exists too
* To create the back-end database, its tables and required stored procedures, simply execute the ToursQueries.sql step by step and it will all be done.
* Make sure to edit the web.config files to your SQL-Server for the back-end to work.

#### Note
* For Javascript field validations instead of ASP.NET validations, visit https://github.com/muhammadhamzach/CureTours/tree/82419775dbc5fa0b83c5019c99516c6ef1ecf41d
